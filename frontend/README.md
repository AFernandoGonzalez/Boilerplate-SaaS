# Component Library/Boilerplate SaaS Frontend

This project is the frontend for the **Component Library/Boilerplate SaaS**, built with **React** and powered by **Vite** for fast development and smooth build processes. This frontend allows developers to browse, preview, and copy reusable components and full-stack boilerplates to accelerate their app development workflows using MERN stack for now.

## Project Overview

The **Component Library/Boilerplate SaaS** is a platform designed to help developers quickly integrate pre-built components and project boilerplates into their applications. It provides:

- A **Component Library**: Developers can browse a set of reusable UI components (e.g., forms, buttons, modals) and integrate them into their projects.
- A **Boilerplate Generator**: Full-stack templates (e.g., MERN stack) that users can download, customize, and deploy to fast-track their application development.
- **Live Previews**: Each component and boilerplate comes with a live preview, so developers can see how it works.

This frontend project provides the user interface for navigating the component and boilerplate libraries, previewing code, and accessing custom download links.

## Technology Stack

This frontend is built using the following technologies:

- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **MongoDB**

## Features

1. **Fast and Efficient**: Built with Vite, this project ensures fast startup times and live reloading during development.
2. **Component and Boilerplate Listings**: Browse a collection of pre-built UI components and boilerplate projects.
3. **Live Previews**: See live previews of components and boilerplates, complete with working examples and usage instructions.
4. **Code**: Easily to copy code snippets for components and boilerplates directly into your project.
5. **User Authentication**: Secure authentication flow to log in and access personalized content.
